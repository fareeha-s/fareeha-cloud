Much of how we connect today involves adding more: more invites, more plans, more coordination.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been wondering if there might be a kind of closeness that fits into the day as it is.

Like when you swap your usual 6pm class for the 5, because your friendâ€™s going to that one. Or wandering to the farmersâ€™ market the same time as your neighbours... your day suddenly feels a touch warmer.

It might seem small, but psychologists call it <a href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5137339/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style='text-decoration: underline;'>intentional synchrony</a>, a natural human principle rooted in our nervous systems. These overlaps are tied to lower loneliness, better regulation, and long-term wellbeing - core to how we rebuild connection at scale.

Surprisingly, almost none of the social platforms we use today are designed to support this. Instead, they often keep us observing each otherâ€™s lives from a distance.

Kineship is meant to embrace a gentler kind of togetherness. It doesnâ€™t ask you to schedule anything or make a plan. It simply shows you when your paths could alignâ€”spin, pilates, Barryâ€™s, whatever your thing is. Some soft cues toward shared presence, and a bit more everyday serendipity.

I'm hoping it makes it just a little easier to say hi, share laughs, linger a bit longer. Even with people you often see around, but don't quite know (yet!) As simple as a smoothie after class ðŸ«¶
